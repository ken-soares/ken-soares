# `$whoami`

Hello, My name is Kenneth Soares, I am a highschool student and coding is my hobby and what I would like to do in the future.
 
This year, I will do at least 4 projects (I **think** I exceeded 4 projects...)

I love Linux, I use a Linux-based OS for everything (Android phone, Manjaro Linux computer, Raspbian mini-server)


I know a few programming languages:
- python
- js
- my own programming language (kasm)
- a bit of rust
