# `$whoami`

Hello, My name is Kenneth Soares, I am a highschool student and coding is my hobby and what I would like to do in the future.


I started coding in 2017. 
This year, I will do at least 4 projects (update:I **think** I exceeded 4 projects...)

I love Linux, I use a Linux-based OS for everything (Android phone, Manjaro Linux computer, Raspbian mini-server). I also love **both** vim and emacs, and you can find my config files for them in my .dotfiles repo (however you will never find a .vscode folder because I hate this editor with a burning passion)


I know a few programming languages:
- python
- js
- my own programming language (kasm)
- a bit of rust
