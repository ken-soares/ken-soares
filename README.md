# `$whoami`

Hello, My name is Kenneth Soares, I am a highschool student and my hobby is to tinker with computers!
 If you look at my repos, you'll quickly understand that I'm not a prodigy but I guess it's not a big deal.  
 
 Anyways, here is a little list of what I know:
 * markdown (duh)
 * python
 * rust
 * bash
 * a very little bit of html,css,php,js

This is all I have to say
